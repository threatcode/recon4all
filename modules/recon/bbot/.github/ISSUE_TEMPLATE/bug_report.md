**Describe the bug**
What happened?

**Expected behavior**
What was supposed to happen?

**BBOT Command**
Example: `bbot -m httpx -t evilcorp.com`

**OS, BBOT Installation Method + Version**
Example: `OS: Arch Linux, Installation method: pip, BBOT version: 1.0.3.545`
Note: You can get the bbot version with `bbot --version`
Note: Windows is **not** supported. We have successfully used BBOT on Docker Desktop in the past, however Windows is highly problematic so if you choose this path you are on your own.

Attach your BBOT config (`bbot --current-config`).

**Logs**
If possible, produce the bug while `--debug` is enabled, and attach the relevant parts of `~/.bbot/logs/bbot.debug.log`

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
