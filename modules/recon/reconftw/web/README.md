# :drop_of_blood: How to contribute:

We tried to make the structure as simple as possible to be understood, with the intention of new collaborators being able to easily read the code and add their knowledge.

We currently have some problems, for example: we cannot load all the information from the database without the server being taken down.

We need to finalize features such as: cancel scan, backup scan, api key config.

We need help! if you have an idea or want to improve our code, please do not hesitate to contact us or contribute directly. We know that a lot can be improved and we have the humbleness to recognize this. 

**Let's make history!**
