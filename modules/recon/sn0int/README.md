sn0int (pronounced [`/snoÉªnt/`][ipa]) is a semi-automatic OSINT framework and
package manager. It's used by IT security professionals, bug bounty hunters,
law enforcement agencies and in security awareness trainings to gather
intelligence about a given target or about yourself. sn0int is enumerating
attack surface by semi-automatically processing public information and mapping
the results in a unified format for followup investigations.

[ipa]: http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=sno%C9%AAnt

Among other things, sn0int is currently able to:

- Harvest subdomains from certificate transparency logs and passive dns
- Mass resolve collected subdomains and scan for http or https services
- Enrich ip addresses with asn and geoip info
- Harvest emails from pgp keyservers and whois
- Discover compromised logins in breaches
- Find somebody's profiles across the internet
- Enumerate local networks with unique techniques like passive arp
- Gather information about phonenumbers
- Harvest activity and images from social media profiles
- Basic image processing

sn0int is heavily inspired by recon-ng and maltego, but remains more flexible
and is fully opensource. None of the investigations listed above are hardcoded
in the source, instead they are provided by modules that are executed in a
sandbox. You can easily extend sn0int by writing your own modules and share
them with other users by publishing them to the sn0int registry. This allows
you to ship updates for your modules on your own instead of pull-requesting
them into the sn0int codebase.

## Rationale

This tool was written for companies to help them understand their attack
surface from a blackbox point of view. It's often difficult to understand that
something is easier to discover than some people assume, putting them at risk
of false security.

It's also designed to be useful for red team assessments and bug bounties,
which also help companies to identify weaknesses that could result in a
compromise.

Some functionality was written to do the same thing for individuals to raise
awareness about personal attack surface, privacy and how much data is publicly
available. These issues are often out of scope in bug bounties and sometimes by
design. We believe that blaming the user is the wrong approach and these issues
should be addressed at the root cause by the people designing those systems.
